    p.govuk-body
      | When more advanced functionality like conditional fields is required,
        the <code>govuk_check_boxes_fieldset</code> helper is recommended. Any
        content passed in via the block will be conditionally revealed when
        the box is checked.

    code: small_checkboxes,

    p.govuk-body
      | Use standard-sized checkboxes in nearly all cases. However, smaller
        versions work well on pages where itâ€™s helpful to make them less visually
        prominent.

    p.govuk-body
      | For example, on a page of search results, the primary user need is to see
        the results. Using smaller checkboxes lets users see and change search
        filters without distracting them from the main content.

    blockquote
      p.govuk-body
        | If a checkbox is unchecked when its form is submitted, there is no value
          submitted to the server to represent its unchecked state

    p.govuk-body
      | To address the empty submission problem outlined above, Rails generates hidden fields with no
        value to represent the unchecked state. This is taken care of by default when using <code>govuk_collection_check_boxes</code>
        and <code>govuk_collection_check_boxes</code> for multiple values. When using <code>govuk_collection_check_boxes</code> for a single value,
        usually a boolean toggle or confirmation, we need to take an exta step and pass in <code>multiple: false</code>.

  == render('/partials/example-fig.*',
    caption: "Generating a single checkbox",
    code: single_checkbox) do

    p.govuk-body
      | Single checkboxes can be used to toggle boolean fields. This pattern
        is most-commonly used for accepting terms and conditions or changing
        settings.

    p.govuk-body
      | When asking users questions, favour the use of 'Yes' and 'No' radio
        buttons. This ensures the user has understood the question and is
        actively selecting the appropriate answer.

    p.govuk-body.important
      | Note that the <code>multiple</code> keyword on
        <code>govuk_check_boxes_fieldset</code> changes the hidden field's
        <code>name</code> attribute to the Rails' single attribute syntax. It is
        required to prevent unnecessary hidden fields from being generated.
