p.govuk-body
  | Checkboxes allow users to:

ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
  li #{link_to("select multiple options from a list", "#generating-a-collection-of-checkboxes").html_safe}
  li #{link_to("toggle a single option on or off", "#generating-a-single-checkbox").html_safe}

p.govuk-body
  | By default the form builder's checkbox helpers will automatically inject a
    hidden field. The hidden field ensures that a parameter is always submitted
    with the form even when no checkboxes have been checked, allowing options
    #{link_to("to be deselected", rails_checkbox_gotcha_link).html_safe}. The
    hidden field can be toggled using the <code>multiple</code> keyword argument.

    p.govuk-body
      | When more advanced functionality like conditional fields is required,
        the <code>govuk_check_boxes_fieldset</code> helper is recommended. Any
        content passed in via the block will be conditionally revealed when
        the box is checked.

    p.govuk-body
      | Use standard-sized checkboxes in nearly all cases. However, smaller
        versions work well on pages where itâ€™s helpful to make them less visually
        prominent.

    p.govuk-body
      | For example, on a page of search results, the primary user need is to see
        the results. Using smaller checkboxes lets users see and change search
        filters without distracting them from the main content.

  == render('/partials/example-fig.*',
    caption: "Generating a single checkbox",
    code: single_checkbox) do

    p.govuk-body
      | Single checkboxes are usually used for boolean fields like accepting
        terms and conditions or toggling a setting.

    p.govuk-body
      | When asking users questions, favour the use of 'Yes' and 'No' radio
        buttons. This ensures the user has understood the question and is
        actively selecting the appropriate answer.

    .important
      p.govuk-body
        | Note that in this example <code>multiple: false</code> is passed to
          both the <code>#govuk_check_boxes_fieldset</code> and
          <code>#govuk_check_box</code> helpers.

      p.govuk-body
        | They're required to ensure the both checkbox's and hidden field's
          <code>name</code> attribute is generated in the format that Rails
          expects for a single field.
