h1.govuk-heading-xl Radio buttons

p.govuk-body-l
  | Use the radios component when users can only select one option from a list.

p.govuk-body
  |
    Radios are grouped together in a <code>fieldset</code> with a
    <code>legend</code> that describes them, as shown in the examples on this
    page.

p.govuk-body
  |
    If you are asking just one question per page as recommended, you can set
    the contents of the <code>legend</code> as the page heading. This is good
    practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the
    contents once.
