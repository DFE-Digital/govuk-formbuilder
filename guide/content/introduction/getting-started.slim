  | The form builder is suitable for use with any Rails application that
    uses the GOV.UK Design System. If you're starting from scratch, the
    easiest way to hit the ground running is to use the
    #{link_to('DfE Rails Boilerplate', dfe_rails_boilerplate_link).html_safe}.

p.govuk-body
  | Once your application is working, simply add the following line to your
    Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code>.

pre
  code.highlight.language-ruby
    | gem 'govuk_design_system_formbuilder'

p.govuk-body
  | Now we just need to tell Rails which form builder to use. We can do
    this globally by amending the <code>ApplicationController</code>.

pre
  code.highlight.language-ruby
    |
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        default_form_builder GOVUKDesignSystemFormBuilder::FormBuilder
      end

p.govuk-body
  | Alternatively, if you're not quite ready to make the full switch, you
    can specify the form builder on a form-by-form basis.

p.govuk-body
  | All examples in this guide are written with
    #{link_to('Slim', slim_link).html_safe} but
    the form builder works just as well with
    #{link_to('ERB', erb_link).html_safe} or
    #{link_to('Haml', haml_link).html_safe}.

pre
  code.highlight.language-slim
    | = form_for @some_object, builder: GOVUKDesignSystemFormBuilder::FormBuilder do |f|
        = f.govuk_text_field :name
        = f.govuk_phone_field :telephone_number

p.govuk-body
  | If you made it this far and everything's working, well done!
