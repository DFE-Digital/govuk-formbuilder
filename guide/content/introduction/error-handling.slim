p.govuk-body
  ' When a form is submitted and there is a problem, communicating that problem
    in a clear and concise manner is imperative. The form builder provides two
    ways to do this.

p.govuk-body
  ' Error messages are displayed immediately above the offending field.
    They should tell the user how to fix the problem.

p.govuk-body
  ' Additionally a summary of all the problems with the submission should be
    displayed at the top of the page. Every error in the summary is a hyperlink
    that when followed focusses on the problematic field.

p.govuk-body
  ' This behaviour is provided by the form builder without any need for
    extra configuration.
