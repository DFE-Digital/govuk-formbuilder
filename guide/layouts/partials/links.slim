          | Every component of the form builder is designed to produce accessible
            HTML that meet all of the design systemâ€™s requirements without having
            to spend time reinventing the wheel.

          | This tool is aimed at developers. If you need a service that
            lets you build forms without writing any code, you can
            use one of the platforms that wrap this library like
            #{link_to_in_new_tab("GOV.UK Forms", govuk_forms_link).html_safe} or
            #{link_to_in_new_tab("MoJ Forms", moj_forms_link).html_safe}.
